# The Biochemical Life Cycle of a Breath

First, let me thank Kaspar Van Der Muelen for his amazing class on breath work and the inspiration (pun intended) for this article.  I highly recommend his course which can be found [here](https://breathworkmasterclass.com/online/).

## Introduction 

In this article we look at the process of a breath from start to finish and some of the biochemistry in between. Without breath there is no life! This process creates the energy vital to all of us. First, we start in the lungs and explore how oxygen (O₂) moves into our circulatory system. How the circulatory system delivers this oxygen to the necessary tissues and the role carbon dioxide plays in this process. Eventually carbon dioxide is exhaled from our lungs but it is not simply a waste gas! Finally, we look at the biochemical process of cellular respiration which creates the energy used to sustain life. 

## Lung - Circulatory Gas Exchange

Below is diagram of the gas exchange process between an alveoli and blood vessel. The alveoli are tiny sacs in our lungs that mediate this exchange.  The diagram below shows the gas exchange with oxygen crossing into our circulatory system and carbon dioxide being offloaded from the ciruclatory system back to the alveoli to be expelled by our lungs.

## Circulatory System

When oxygen enters our blood vessels through the lungs, it is carried to the heart which pumps it throughout our circulatory system. In the diagram below, the arteries carry oxygen rich blood away from the heart to be delivered to our cells for cellular respiration (energy production). The transfer of oxygen rich blood becoming carbon dioxide rich blood happens at the capillaries. Shown as the purplish smaller lines in the diagram. The presence of CO₂ in the capillaries signals the red blood cells to deliver the O₂ to the cell. CO₂ rich blood is then carried back to the heart and lungs by veins where it is eventually exhaled through our lungs.

## Cellular Respiration

Cellular respiration is how our cells use oxygen to create energy. There are two main types of respiration: aerobic which uses oxygen and anaerobic which does not use oxygen. 

### **Aerobic Respiration**

### **6O₂ + C₆H₁₂O₆ ==> 6H₂O + 6CO₂ + ATP**

In aerobic respiration, our cells use glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) and oxygen (6O₂) to create carbon dioxide (6CO₂), water (6H₂O), and energy (ATP). The oxygen that started in our aveoli has journeyed all the way to an individual cell to be used in energy production. As a result of this energy production process water and carbon dioxide are produced. The carbon dioxide is then carried by our circulatory system back our heart and then to the lungs to be expelled. 

One very interesting thing to note. 

The reason we breath faster when we exercise is not to increase the amount of oxygen in our blood but to offload excess carbon dioxide from our blood. The amount of oxygen in our blood that can be used by our tissues is almost always stable between 95-100% even during exercise. This means that when our breathing rate increases the concentration of oxygen in our blood does *not* increase as well. So how does more oxygen get to the tissues that are working to create more energy? Remember that in the process of creating energy carbon dioxide is also produced. The increase of carbon dioxide in our blood makes oxygen more available to our tissues in something known as the Bohr Effect.  This allows the tissues that are producing the most energy (and carbon dioxide!) to receive the most oxygen. It is also the presence of carbon dioxide in our blood that the brain monitors and uses to control the breathing stimulus. As the amount of carbon dioxide in our blood increases the urge to breath also increases.

### **Anaerobic Respiration**

### **Glucose ==> Lactic Acid + ATP** 

Anaerobic respiration is how our cells produce energy in the absence of oxygen. This process is less efficient than aerobic respiration but the energy is delivered much more quickly. If, for example, our muscles are doing intense or explosive movements, aerobic respiration cannot provide enough energy quickly enough and anaerobic respiration is necessary. The biological mechanism for how anaerobic respiration supplies energy more quickly is not clear to me. If anyone reading this with a better understanding of biology/exercise physiology please let me know and I will update this.

## Conclusion 

That concludes the amazing life-cycle of a breath. We breathe in and fresh oxygen is delivered from the alveolus in our lungs to our circulatory system. This oxygen rich blood is pumped throughout our circulatory system to be used in cellular respiration to create energy. The creation of energy produces carbon dioxide which enters our circulatory system making the blood rich in carbon dioxide.  The excess carbon dioxide in our blood signals the brain to provide the stimulus to breathe out and carbon dioxide is exhaled back out through our lungs. What an amazing and beautiful cycle that sustains all of our lives!
