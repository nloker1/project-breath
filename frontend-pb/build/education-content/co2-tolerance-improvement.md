# How to Increase CO₂ Tolerance for Enhanced Oxygen Utilization

Improving carbon dioxide (CO₂) tolerance is a somewhat unorthodox yet incredibly effective way to enhance athletic performance, mental clarity, and overall well-being. A higher tolerance for CO₂ can lead to better oxygen utilization, a concept deeply rooted in the Bohr Effect, which states that the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen decreases as CO₂ concentration increases, thereby facilitating oxygen release to the tissues that need it most. Here are some advanced techniques to increase CO₂ tolerance, including altitude training, breath-hold training, and, for the more adventurous, bag breathing.
