# Carbon Dioxide Tolerance Test

## Step 1: Measure your Breath Ability

1. Take three easy, calm breaths in and out through the nose.
2. Take one full nasal inhale, filling the abdomen, upper chest, and lungs.
3. Start a timer as you exhale through pursed lips, as slow as possible. You can use a simple stopwatch or any online timer.
4. Stop the timer when you run out of air, swallow, or feel that you must take a breath in.

## Step 2: Assess your Breath Ability

- **80+ seconds**: Elite. Reflects an advanced pulmonary adaptation, excellent motor control, and low stress sensitivity.
- **60-80 seconds**: Advanced. Reflects a healthy pulmonary system, good motor control, and relatively low arousal.
- **40-60 seconds**: Intermediate. This range generally improves quickly with a focus on COâ‚‚ tolerance training.
- **20-40 seconds**: Average. Moderate to high arousal state. Breathing mechanics may need improvement.
- **0-20 seconds**: Awesome candidate for breathwork. Very high arousal and stress sensitivity.
