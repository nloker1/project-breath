# The Physiology of Respiratory Regulation

Have you ever wondered how we continue breathing even when alseep, in a coma, or otherwise unconscious? How does the brain signal respiratory muscles to continue drawing in freshly oxygenated air and expelling CO2? Below we dive into how this mircalous process works and take a deeper look at the phsyiology of respiratory regulation. 

Breathing in humans is primarily regulated by the respiratory control centers in the brain, which constantly monitor and respond to the levels of oxygen (O2), carbon dioxide (CO2), and the pH level of the blood. Here's how the process works:

1. **Central Chemoreceptors**: Located in the medulla oblongata of the brain, these chemoreceptors are sensitive to the pH of their environment. They cannot directly sense CO2, but when CO2 levels in the blood rise, it leads to an increase in the concentration of carbonic acid, which lowers the pH of the cerebrospinal fluid. This decrease in pH is detected by the central chemoreceptors.

2. **Peripheral Chemoreceptors**: These are located in the carotid bodies at the bifurcation of the carotid artery and in the aortic bodies above and below the aortic arch. They are sensitive to the partial pressures of oxygen (PaO2), carbon dioxide (PaCO2), and the pH of the blood.

3. **Medullary Respiratory Center**: This center in the brainstem (medulla oblongata and pons) processes the information received from chemoreceptors and sends signals to the muscles involved in breathing.

The primary driver for the breathing stimulus under normal conditions is the level of CO2 in the blood. Here's the general sequence of events:

1. **CO2 Levels Rise**: An increase in CO2 in the blood (hypercapnia) leads to an increase in H+ ions (decreased pH), mainly due to the conversion of CO2 to carbonic acid in the blood.
2. **Stimulation of Chemoreceptors**: The central chemoreceptors in the medulla are sensitive to the pH of their environment. When CO2 levels rise, the pH lowers, and these chemoreceptors are stimulated.
3. **Respiratory Rate Increases**: This stimulation sends signals to the respiratory center of the brain, leading to an increase in the rate and depth of breathing. 
4. **Oxygen Levels**: Although CO2 is the primary driver, a significant drop in oxygen levels (hypoxemia) can also stimulate breathing through peripheral chemoreceptors, but this is generally a secondary mechanism compared to the body's sensitivity to CO2 levels.

In summary, the breathing stimulus is primarily triggered by the level of CO2 in the blood, which is closely monitored by chemoreceptors in the brain. When these receptors detect a deviation from normal levels, they initiate a response to adjust the breathing rate and depth to stabilize the levels of CO2, O2, and pH in the blood.
